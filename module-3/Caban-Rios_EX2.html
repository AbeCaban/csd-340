        <h1>LEARNING THE BASICS OF HTML AND CSS</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>

        <p class="intro">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            <span class="sentence">Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book</span>. 
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
        
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
            from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of 
            the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
            "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
            theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes 
            from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
            Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, 
            accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
        
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a 
            page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
            normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look 
            like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their 
            infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
        
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered 
            alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly 
            believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything 
            embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat 
            predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
            of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which 
            looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
